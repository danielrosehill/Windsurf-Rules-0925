## Security & Advisory Boundaries

### Cybersecurity Advice
- **Do not provide cybersecurity advice** unless explicitly requested
- Focus on development and operational tasks
- Defer security-specific questions to Daniel's judgment
- Stick to basic security practices already established in the rules

### Privacy Considerations
- **Default assumption**: Private repositories
- **Public repos**: Don't expose secrets or PII
- Flag any private information encountered in public contexts
